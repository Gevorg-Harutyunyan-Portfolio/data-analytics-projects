Ik ben een gepassioneerde en gedreven violiste met heel wat eigen solistische en kamermuzische projecten naast mijn vaste plaats in de Opera.  Mijn hobby is mijn beroep en mijn beroep mijn hobby. Sinds 2019 studeer ik er nog een Bachelor Jazz bij. Naast muziek hou ik van alle vormen van kunst alsook de kunst van het leven zelf. Mijn twee zonen, (de ene zoon werkt aan een Phd en de andere zoon maakt deel uit van een zelfstandig verpleegkundig team), zijn beiden ook muzikaal begaafd, zij spelen gitaar en piano. In december trouwde ik voor de tweede maal met een topman. Hij werkt in het stafteam van Stad Gent, departement opvoeding, jeugd en onderwijs. Hij heeft een passie voor lekkere wijn, creatief koken, reizen en het is zalig leven met hem. Vijf dingen waar ik niet buiten kan: mijn kinderen, mijn man, familie, ouders, mijn viool, muziek in het algemeen, mijn huis dat volledig verbouwd is naar eigen smaak en onze ""tempel"" is waar we ons gelukkig voelen, mijn vrienden en sociale contacten, mijn computer. Mijn favoriete reisbestemmingen zijn  Schotland, Zwitserland, Frankrijk, Engeland, Zuid-Korea, Tenerife, Spanje. Ik hou van boeken over psychologie, boeken over muziek en kunst. Favoriete films zijn alle films van Lars von Trier, Andrej Tarkovski, ""de andere film"" in het algemeen, maar ik hou ook van James Bond films en ""gemakkelijkere"" films. Ik hou van Koreaans eten, van de Franse keuken, Italiaanse keuken, de goeie Belgische keuken en van alle lekkere gerechten die met liefde klaargemaakt zijn.

Born and raised in Moorslede and Bruges, we studied in Ghent and in Brussels. We fell in love and decided to settle in the beautiful city of Ghent. Whilst looking for a place to live, we bumped into what could be considered as one of the most centralised houses of Ghent. The house was old, dark and didn’t catch a lot of sunlight, but we saw a lot of possibilities to transform it into a little paradise in the ancient centre, close to all the hip and trendy places this city has to offer. As we travel a lot ourselves, we think we know what it takes to have a pleasant stay and discovering new cities and countries. We transformed the house in an ideal place for friends and guests visiting Ghent. By the summer of 2020 the house was finished.   
We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. 
Welcome in Ghent!

I'm Veerle from Ghent.  During college I spent a year in Costa Rica as part of a student exchange program.   I stayed in the house of a lovely family.  They were wonderfully hospitable and after a while I even called them my mammi, pappi & hermanas :-).  I really felt at home there.  I quickly realized how amazing it is to be able to have a home away from home.  Since then, when I travel I always look for a place to stay that gives me that same feeling.  And when my friends, family or you :-)  come to visit beautiful Ghent I try to offer that same kind of hospitality.

Why not also visit the historic<br />city centre and admire the fascinating Gothic and Romanesque architecture?

Why not also visit the historic city centre and admire the fascinating Gothic and Romanesque architecture? Saint Bavo’s Cathedral and Saint Nicholas’ Church are prominent examples of this architectural style, along with an intricately detailed interior. For art enthusiasts, the Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Museum of Fine Arts) is a must-see, containing thousands of exhibitions and preserved pieces of art from the late Middle Ages all the way up to the first half of the 20th century.

We recommend visiting top-rated Gravensteen attraction – a 10th century majestic castle built in a moat offering a stunning backdrop of the city. Why not also visit the historic city centre and admire the fascinating Gothic and Romanesque architecture? Saint Bavo’s Cathedral and Saint Nicholas’ Church are prominent examples of this architectural style, along with an intricately detailed interior. For art enthusiasts, the Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Museum of Fine Arts) is a must-see, containing thousands of exhibitions and preserved pieces of art from the late Middle Ages all the way up to the first half of the 20th century. Other notable mentions include the Museum of Contemporary Art, Korenlei, and Kasteel van Ooidonk.<br",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-1305226798418319867/original/a03fd772-94d5-411f-a24d-b1b3c48f677e.jpeg,502108298,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/502108298,Eduardo,2023-02-21,,"",within an hour,100%,100%,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4ad08b80-9d0a-4bb7-aca3-d3490a10cbc5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/4ad08b80-9d0a-4bb7-aca3-d3490a10cbc5.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,9,10,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Gent, Vlaams Gewest, Belgium",Elisabethbegijnhof - Papegaai,,51.0490128,3.713107099999999,Entire rental unit,Entire home/apt,6,2.0,2 baths,3,3,"[""Dishes and silverware"", ""Oven"", ""Dryer"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Coffee"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Bed linens"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Stove"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Shampoo"", ""Waterfront"", ""Private entrance"", ""Hot water"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Elevator"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Washer"", ""Heating"", ""Shower gel"", ""Kitchen"", ""TV"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Self check-in"", ""Freezer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Toaster"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Dining table"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Hangers"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Crib"", ""Paid parking off premises"", ""Microwave"", ""Bathtub"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Free parking on premises"", ""Clothing storage"", ""Lockbox"", ""Wifi""]",$770.00,1,365,1,2,365,365,2.0,365.0,,t,27,57,87,177,2024-12-25,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,t,6,6,0,0,
